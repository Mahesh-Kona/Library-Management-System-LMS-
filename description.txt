Library Management System(LMS)

This is completely based on our real time library.  Where  you can perform the tasks such as

Displaying all the books in the library
Search for a book
Add a book to our library
Update the details of a book
Search for a book wether it is there in our library or not
Issue a book to the reader
Returning the  book by the reader & it can be done only when this book is issued to that reader
Remove a book from library

I used python library named PANDAS for this project and also an excel file for storing details of books of the library
